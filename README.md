Hi, I am an spanish telecommunication engineer with over 30 years of experience. During my professional life I have been in quite different sectors although 
all of then related to software development. I began working for the University at its AI lab for four years, and after that I passed 10 year working for a 
Telco company making projects related to AI. Very interesting those years, but, with the boom of Internet I decided to change and ended in a big Media Company 
where I have stayed for more than 20 year in charge of the digital development direction.

My loves are my family, programming, electronics and flying in ultralight.
